### Simulated Annealing

Simulated annealing is a method for finding a good (not necessarily perfect) solution to an optimization problem. This notebook implements simulated annealing to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) between US state capitals. 

### Getting Started

To launch the notebook, run the following command from a terminal with anaconda3 installed and on the application path:

    jupyter notebook AIND-Simulated_Annealing.ipynb

### Requirements

- Python 2.7 and above
